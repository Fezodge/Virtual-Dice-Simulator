# Virtual-Dice-Simulator
This is the C# files for the Open Source Virtual Dice Simulator application I created. This program randomly generates numbers to represent shaking dice, without the added effects of wind resistance, angle of throw, force of throw, etc.  
*Please note that as it stands at the moment, this application is only available in console mode. No GUI has been created yet!*
